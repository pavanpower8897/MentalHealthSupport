<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  We all experience problems in our lives. Sometimes those are situational and quickly resolved. Sometimes they can be more serious and difficult to handle. Counseling Services helps students with a wide range of mental health concerns. If you or someone you know is stressed by life circumstances, experiencing mental health symptoms, or have any thoughts of suicide, please talk to a caring professional.
</p>
<p>
  However, keep in mind that the mere absence of mental health concerns does not equal positive mental health and wellness. There is a lot we can do to accentuate the positive and buffer ourselves from depression and other forms of mental concerns.
</p>
<p>
Emotional, mental, and social health often cannot be separated. They each contribute greatly to our overall well-being. Emotional health emphasizes an awareness and acceptance of oneâ€™s thoughts and feelings. Social health encompasses connecting with community, family, friends, and co-workers in ways that enrich your life and the lives of those around you.
